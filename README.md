# About BestLife

Health is one of the most important factors to a functioning society. BestLife aims to help individuals track a large variety of factors (stress, physical activity, social activity, nutrition, etc.) on a weekly basis. Then, users can visualize these habits in a HeatMap across the number of weeks they have submitted the form.

Our goal with this app is for users to be able to recognize when their habits are good and when they start to suffer. From there, users can self-diagnose what may have led to the trends shown in the heat map.

When all of us are exhibiting good health habits, we will all become better functioning members of society!
